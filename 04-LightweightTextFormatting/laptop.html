<h2 id="definition-of-the-laptop">Definition of the Laptop</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">laptop</a> computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. </p>
<p>Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is in the lower part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-laptops">Types of Laptops</h2>
<p>Since the 1970s introduction of portable computers, their forms have changed significantly, resulting in a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses. Excepting distinct legal trademark around terms (notably Ultrabook), hard distinctions between these classes were rare, and their usage has varied over time and between sources. Since the late 2010s, more specific terms have become less commonly used, with sizes distinguished largely by the size of the screen.</p>
<p>There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low cost &quot;netbooks&quot;, and &quot;ultra-mobile PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware.</p>
<p>The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.</p>
<h2 id="laptop-hardware">Laptop Hardware</h2>
<p>The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.</p>
<p>In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, except for components that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. In the past, many laptops featured socketed processors but as of 2025 virtually all laptops use processors that are soldered to the motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced.</p>
