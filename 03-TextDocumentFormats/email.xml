Ahoy, Captain Jones,
I trust the seas have been as cruel to you as ever. Word has reached me—via a rather talkative crab—that you’re still in possession of that charming little box they call the Dead Man’s Chest.
        
Now, while I admire your dedication to keeping your heart under lock and key (quite literally), I find myself in need of reclaiming what’s rightfully mine… or at least temporarily borrowed. I propose a civilized parley—no cannons, no krakens, just a bottle of rum and a gentleman’s understanding.
       
Do let me know when the tides favor such a meeting.

Yours in infamy (and occasional honesty),

Captain Jack Sparrow
